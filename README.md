# CIS-043-Blackjack
A game of Blackjack with a TWIST!
Team project for CIS-043
Written in Java using swing

Description:
You have the option to play as either NORMAL mode or SPECIAL mode.

In NORMAL mode, you play Blackjack with the classic rules in which the player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card.
In SPECIAL mode, the player starts with one card. Instead of drawing two cards at the beginning, players will draw one card and can choose to draw a second card. If the player chooses to draw a second card, then the bid will double. Also cards Jack, Queen, King now have values 11, 12, 13 respectively.
