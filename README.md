You have the option to play as either NORMAL mode or SPECIAL mode.<br/>

NORMAL mode: You play Blackjack with the classic rules in which the player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card.<br/>
SPECIAL mode: The player starts with one card. Instead of drawing two cards at the beginning, players will draw one card and can choose to draw a second card. If the player chooses to draw a second card, then the bid will     double. Also cards Jack, Queen, King now have values 11, 12, 13 respectively.<br/>
